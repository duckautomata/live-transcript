 * NOTE:
 * The tests require at least 2 pages of transcript lines in order for the pagination tests to work.
 * Best to keep the number of searchTerm results < 5 since virtual lists do not show all results. Best if 1-3 results.
 * searchLineId just needs to be one of the searchTerm results, order doesn't matter.
