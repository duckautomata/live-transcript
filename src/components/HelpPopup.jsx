                                Clipping allows you to generate a media clip that spans multiple lines in the
                                transcript. The benefits with using this instead of downloading each line separately is

                                    This is the tagging alignment menu. It takes the discord message ID of your tag, and
                                    calculates the offset you need for it to align with the beginning of the segment you

                                    <li>

                                    The default offset is whatever your server&#39;s tagger bot is set to. For DPS, it
                                    is -20. This value is also stored in the cookie, so you will only have to change it
                                    once.

                                Note:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        As said above, this will time the tag to the beginning of the section you
                                        clicked. Meaning, that if an entire line is one section, then it will time it to
                                        go at the beginning of that line. The only way to make it start in the middle of
                                        a section is to guess how long a section is and change the offset accordingly.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The timings seem to be very accurate. When you want to start at the beginning of
                                        the section, it might be best to move it back by one second to give the YT
                                        player time to start the video/audio. Though this should be determined after
                                        testing it out for a few streams.
